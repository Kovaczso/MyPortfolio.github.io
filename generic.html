									<p>My very first EU project was taking part in a creation of the Indirect Roles Dashboard. The Indirect Roles (IR) dashboard supports accurate planning & forecasting of training requirements as well
										as giving visibility on IR competency, information about test results per role & time-on-task. </p>
									<p>The tool allows the L&D team to Identify the gaps between Indirect Role targets and associates who are fully eligible to be deployed
										on task (trained with practice). Dive deep into Indirect Roles statuses and plan and execute actions based on dashboard
										recommendation to secure headcounts for indirect processes. Check and follow up on the knowledge test results at role and individual levels to make sure the
										training is effective and only competent associates work in the roles. </p>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/linde (2).jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Powered industrial trucks, commonly called forklifts or lift trucks, are used in many industries, primarily to move materials. They can also be used to raise, lower, or remove large objects or a number of smaller objects on pallets or in boxes, crates, or other containers. Powered industrial trucks can either be ridden by the operator or controlled by a walking operator.</p>
									<p>As a member of a PIT Community of Practice in 2022 I have been collaborating with EU countries on a mission to standardize EU Learning PIT training content, aligning all content with EU and worldwide standards, updating content as a PIT related processes change and also providing support to project teams that touch our area of expertise.   </p>
									<p>The PIT Pick & Stow at Height Community of Practice (CoP) is a group of learning team members formed with Learning Managers, Specialists and Trainers with a passion for developing outstanding PIT training and coaching standards. We are responsible to ensure the training content is standardized, accurate and updated by working alongside other departments (ACES, EHS...) and the Content & Design Team.</p>

							<p>Global Road Safety partnered with multiple business units to scope and expand the formally known application of Trailer Dock and Release (TDR) to Global Transportation Dock and Release (GTDR). The GTDR application will enable all facilities to use a mobile application as a replacement to the paper checklist for TDR. GTDR has improved safety, productivity, and dock operations. Leveraging technology is the key to providing a safe and organized trailer yard. </p>
							<p>Our mission was to allign with EU standards and create a training material for our associates. The training material had to be designed to all associates involved in TDR procedures. Trainers would organize a classroom training for all associates, where we introduce the new app and its usage to them.</p>
							<p>During planning of all the trainings I took an opportunity and created a new interactive PowerPoint presentation. The training itself is really long, and I aimed to create a presentation with eye-catching features so I can keep my audience occupied for the whole length of the training. The picture shows the first slide where I created button navigators out of shapes which acts like a mobile app while using them.</p>

					<p>Working in Amazon does not always mean hard labour and pushing your boundaries. In most cases Amazon is a place where peploe gaining knowledge on daily bases and also a place where you can have fun.  </p>
					<p>Fun Team is here for us to create new fun activity every week. I have joined a lot of them, and even if I did not win a price I was always happy that I could join. One of them were a competition to create a logo for Amazon EU Reverse Logistics.</p>
					<p>For this purpose I used PowerPoint to create the mentioned logo. Even though I did not win I was really happy with the logo itself. </p>

					<span class="image main"><img src="images/dbe.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>A part of corporate trainers job is to have an overview of metrics and be able to analize them. These metrics must be readable by a Trainers and they must take actions upon them if required. All our data flow can be seen on a platform whicg is managed by the Metrics teams. Their mission is to collect data of performance, KPI, trainings, etc and visualize them for us to be used.</p>
					<p>One of my ideas was to create a simple Excel file where we can track some details of New Hires our way. As we missed some new hires for training I decided to track all new hires in this Excel. Let's have a look how does it works.</p>
					<p>Let me start with data insert. For inserting the initial data we use column C where we insert employee IDs of the new hires. After inserting you will see that certain cells in the row will fill up. Column A will show us the week number where I used this formula - ="WK"&WEEKNUM(B2,1)-1. It references to Column B where with the help of using formula - =IF(C2<>"",IF(B2<>"",B2,NOW()),"") the cells in Column B will tell the exact date and time of an entry without updating. That means, when I open this Excel file tomorrow, the values in Column B will stay the same. Next are Columns D:I where I used an easy VLookUp function to find details about associates from our active roster. Moving on we can see Column J with function =IF(L2<=TODAY(),"YES","NO"). You can see that the function references to Column L which is formated as date and the value wound be - date in Column B + 7. Why 7? Because that's the estimated date to perform the first face to face coaching. So to wrapp it up, when I enter an ID into the sheet, in Column B pops up a date a value was entered into Column C. If Column J shows Yes, that means that new hire is ready for him first Face 2 Face Coaching. Last important Column is showing the week number of the Face 2 Face coaching based on the date in Column L. Coaching for week 3 and 4 are the same. The greyed out Columns M, Q, U needs to be filled by a Trainer after the coaching was done. When the new hire recieves the last Coaching in his week 4 and Trainer records it into Column U, Column V will turn into 'Completed' which means that the new hire recieved all Coaching sessions</p>

					<p>As part of my self development I also created a visualization for our collected data. MS PowerBI was my choice as the data source is in MS Excel and I am use to MS platforms. The dashboard itself was created to visualize our collected data in a way that everyone in our enviroment can read it and also work with it. Other than just reading data, the dashboard is used to support other deparments with correct data.</p>
					<p>New Hires page - An insight page that tells us details about our hiring.</p>
					<p>F2F Coaching page - Detailed informations about coaching sessions. Data on this page helps us plan coaching sessions beforhand.</p>
					<p>F2F Weekly Pool page - This pool is the most used page of all. The pool table is set up so it will only show associates needed to be coached in a certain week. With being said, when the day comes and our new hired associate became eligible for their coaching session, this pool tells us exaclty the coaching week. New hires are shown in the pool as long as the coaching had not been done. As soon as they recieve a coaching session, after the database update, they disapear from the pool.</p>
					<p>WHD Transfers page - Often happened that as a team we were asked about some details about transfers between various department. Often had to dig really deep to find answers which I personally hated. So this page comes in handy when we are asked questions.</p>
