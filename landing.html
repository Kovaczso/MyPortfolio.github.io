										<h2>How I started?</h2>
									</header>
									<p>After spending 5 years in Northern Ireland I moved back to Slovakia and started my career in Amazon in 2020. That time I was employed by a recruitment agency 
										and later on I have got a Amazon contract. Being curious and ambitious got me to L&D department where I am spending a lot of time with self development. I have been constantly gaining 
										knowledge about the role, learning how to use MS tools such as Excel and a lot more. Once I have learned something new I immediately started to use the knowledge or skill in my daily tasks. 
										Let's have a closer look!
